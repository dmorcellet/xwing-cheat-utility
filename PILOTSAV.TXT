X-Wing Cheat Utility (XWCU) by Damien MORCELLET v2.0

This text file explains how the information about your X-wing pilots are
stored in the .PLT file in the XWING directory...
Some items were very easy to find (for example, where are stored the different
scores), some other were not at all. Especially to find how X-wing knows what
operation the pilot has completed in the Tour of Duty.

Warning !! If you do not know what a byte is, or how to use hexa, skip
that file, and just use XWCU to revive your pilots...

I hope the others will find a little interest in having a look at this file.
For sure, hackers gonna be happy !!

Struture of the .PLT file :

The X-wing .PLT files are 1706 bytes long...
That's where you pilot rest between missions...
There's a lot of free bytes in that f... .PLT so that lots of tours and
historic missions may be added, without changing the file's length !

Now, let's go inside the bytes....

(Offset = Content & Meaning)
$02 = The pilot's status. $00 means 'alive', ready to fly missions...
                          $01 means 'captured' by the Empire
                          $02 means 'killed' during Tour of Duty

$03 = The pilot's rank.   $00 is Flight Cadet, $01 is Flight Officer 
                          $02 is Lieutenant, $03 is Captain
                          $04 is Commander, $05 is General

$04-$07 = TOD points (shown in Pilot Log : 'Alive with ... TOD points'
        Lower bytes come first...

$08-$09 = Historic missions points...
          0-16383 : Rookie, 16384-32767 : Officer, 32768-49151 : Veteran
          49152-65534 : Ace, 65535 : Top Ace (yeah !)

$0A = $01 if you got the Corellian Cross, and $00 else.
$0B = $01 if you got the Mantooine Medallion
$0C = $01 if you got the Star of Alderaan
$0D = $01 if you got the Shield of Yavin (in Imperial Pursuit)
$05 = $01 if you got the Talons of Hoth (at the end of B-wing)

$11 = Kalidor Crescent
        $00 = None (you're not brave enough to wear it)
        $01 = Kalidor Crescent only
        $02 = a Bronze Cluster is added to the Kalior Crescent
        $03 = Adds Silver Talons
        $04 = Adds Silver Scimitar
        $05 = Adds Golden Wings
        $06 = Adds Diamond Eyes 
      
$26-$29 = X-wing proving ground high score
$2A-$2D = id for Y-wing
$2E-$31 = id for A-wing
$32-$35 = id for B-wing

$86-$89 = Stores the level you reached in the proving grounds
          (0= no level,1..8) respectively for X-wing,Y-wing,A-wing,B-wing 
          (one byte for each craft)

$9E-9F = sometimes, those bytes are not $00, but I don't know what they mean.

$A0-DF = 64 bytes where the X-wing historic missions scores are stored.
         4 bytes for each mission... 6 missions ! Hey.. 6*4=24, isn't ??
         You guess, that means there may be 16 missions for a single craft !
$E0-$11F = id for Y-wing...
$120-$15F = id for A-wing...
$160-$19F = id for B-wing
$160-$21F = Empty spaces for 2 other crafts...

$220-$27F = Used to know if a mission has been completed or not...
A $00 means the mission has NOT been completed, and guess what a $01 means !
   $220-$22F : 6 bytes for the X-wing missions of the basic game, and then
               10 empty bytes for future missions ?
   $230-$23F : For Y-wing ; $240-$24F : For A-wing ; $250-$25F : For B-wing
   $260-$27F : Empty spaces for 16*2=48 missions and 2 other crafts...

$280 indicates the current Tour of Duty...
     $00 = Tour I (A new ally)
     $01 = Tour II (The Great Search)
     $02 = Tour III (The Gathering Storm)
     $03 = Tour IV (Imperial Pursuit)
     $04 = Tour V (B-wing)

$281 is a byte that counts the times you went in the current TOD mission
     without any success... What is the interest ?

$282,$283 should have the same value, which is the number of the current
mission in the current Tour of Duty, minus 1. So that Operation 1 = $00
for example...
$287 contains the operation you have to play now... (Op 1 = $00 ...)
     In Imperial Pursuit : Op 6a=$05, Op 6b=$06, Op 7=$07, Op 8a=$08
$288 is $FF is there is not two operations available at the same time
     contains the code for the second operation is there is one...
     for example if you play Op 6b of Imperial Pursuit :
     $287=$05, $288=$06

$2E0-$2E7 = One byte for each Tour... and then $00 for future Tours
      a $00 means : this tour has never been selected
      a $01 means : this tour is active
      a $02 means : this tour is incomplete (you already tried it, but you
                    gave up for another one...)
      a $03 means : this tour has been completed... Congratulations !!!
For example, $00-$02-$01-$00-$00 means that you tried Tour II (and you
completed some missions, maybe, and then you selected Tour III, which is now 
'Active').

$2E8-$2EF = Indicates which of the Tour of Duty Operations are available for
Historic Missions training... One byte for each Tour... and $FF for the others
        $FF means that no missions are available for the Tour.
        Else, the missions are all available until Operation nø (value+1)
For example, $2E8-$2EF = 07 FF 00 FF FF FF FF FF means that Operations 1 to 8
of Tour I can be played as an Historic Mission. As well as Operation 1 of
Tour III. Following $FF are for future tours (I hope so !).

$2F0-$2F7 = The three first bytes are respectively for Tour I,II,III and the
others are for future tours... Their value is the number of the last
successful operation in the Tour ($00 means:no operation have been completed)
For example 09 00 01 means you have completed Operations 1 to 9 in Tour I, no
operation in Tour II, and Operation 1 of Tour III.

You know, I'm sure you guessed that there is enough space for 8 different
tours ! So, I'm waiting for 3 other tours to come ! 

$2F8-$35B = 25 * 4 bytes to store the scores of the 12 operations in Tour I.
            Of course, only the 12*4=24 first bytes have a meaning...
$35C-$3BF = The same for the 12 operations of Tour II
$3C0-$413 = The same for the 14 operations of Tour III...
$414-$477 = The same for the 24 operations of Tour IV
$478-$4DB = The same for the 24 operations of Tour V

Then follows lots of empty bytes to store the scores for future tours...

$630-$633 = Tour of Duty Crafts Destroyed (computed by X-wing...)
$634-$635 = Tour Of Duty Surface Victories

$636-$695 = In that area are stored the number of crafts you've destroyed or
            captured... Lower bytes come always first...
( Craft ; Offset for destroyed crafts ; Offset for captured crafts )
        X-wing :              $636-37 ; $666-67
        Y-wing :              $638-39 ; $668-69
        A-wing :              $63A-3B ; $66A-6B
        TIE Fighter :         $63C-3D ; $66C-6D
        TIE Interceptor :     $63E-3F ; $66E-6F

        Transport :           $644-45 ; $674-75
        Shuttle :             $646-47 ; $676-77
        Tug :                 $648-49 ; $678-79 
        Container :           $64A-4B ; $67A-7B

        Calamari Cruiser :    $64E-4F ; $67E-7F
        Nebulon B Frigate :   $650-51 ; $680-81
        Corellian Corvette :  $652-53 ; $682-83 
        Star Destroyer :      $654-55 ; $684-85
        TIE Advanced :        $656-57 ; $686-87 
        B-wing                $658-59 ; $688-89  
        No craft :            $65A-5D ; $68A-8D
                (those 2 words are added to Mines)
        Mines :               $65E-5F ; $68E-8F
        No craft :            $660-61 ; $690-91
                (this word is added to Communication Satellites)
        Comm. Satellites :    $662-63 ; $692-93
        Space Probe :         $664-65 ; $694-95

Note : There's a bug in B-wing. That is, if you destroy a B-wing, it will be
       counted as if you'd destroyed a Mine...
       XWCU let's you see how many B-wing you killed (see Pilot Log...)

$696-$699 = Tour of Duty Laser Fired
$69A-$69D = Tour of Duty Laser Craft Hits (yeah !)
$69E-$6A1 = Tour of Duty Laser Ground Hits
$6A2-$6A3 = Tour of Duty Homing Projectiles Fired 
$6A4-$6A5 = Tour of Duty Homing Projectiles Craft Hits (yeah !)
$6A6-$6A7 = Tour of Duty Homing Projectiles Ground Hits

$6A8-$6A9 = Tour of Duty crafts lost (bouh !)

That's all folks...
