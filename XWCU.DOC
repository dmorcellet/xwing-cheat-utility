 X-Wing Cheat Utility v1.0 by Damien MORCELLET, Sup‚lec student (FRANCE)

   Once upon a time, I used to play X-Wing without cheating (YES!). My
 pilots were always killed or captured by the evil galactic Empire...
   So...
   I decided to have a look at that $*œ#^&@ (censored) .PLT file...
   A few hours later, I knew how to modify its f... bytes the way I
 wanted ! Little by little, I discovered how to modify ALL the attributes
 of a X-wing pilot !

   Of course, I tried first to find out how to revive a pilot, then how to
 play the mission I want, whenever I want. And play the last missions of
 Tour III, you know, when you have to destroy the Death Star...

   And now, YOU can modify WHATEVER you want with XWCU !!!
   If you have some trouble using XWCU, please contact me :
