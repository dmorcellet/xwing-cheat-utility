XWCU v2.0 : Installation, Comments ...

WHAT IS XWCU v2.0 ??
--------------------
First, XWCU means X-Wing Cheat Utility
It simply allows you to edit your X-Wing pilots but :

        You can edit EVERYTHING in the .PLT file
        You can ENJOY a GREAT menus/windows interface

How to use XWCU ???
-------------------
- Make a directory on your hard drive (XWCU for example)
- This directory must contain XWCU essential files :
        - XCWU.EXE ( of course :-D )
        - XWCU.DOC ( text shown by the menu item 'about XWCU' )
        - MENUS.DOC ( menus description file )
        - WINDOWS.DOC (windows description file )
        - XWCU.CFG ( configuration file )
        - T.FNT ( the text font )

- Before you run XWCU you MUST configure it : edit XWCU.CFG and give the
  path for your X-wing program.
  ex : XWINGPATH=c:\games\xwing

- To run XWCU, you MUST be in its directory !

- That's all folks...

Other NOTES
-----------
- PILOTSAV.TXT is a file which describes the .PLT file structure. Enjoy it if
  you're a true hacker...

- This version of XWCU works with X-wing,B-wing and Imperial Pursuit.
  You can use it with X-wing only, or with only one other module

- You can tell me everything you want (about this program for example)
  using eMail :
        MORCELLE_DAM@LSI.SUPELEC.FR

- Last, but not least ... XWCU is postcard-ware (that is, if you choose to
  use XWCU regularly, I would like you to send me a postcard from where you
  are... (except if it bothers you !!! :-D ).

- New versions will be posted at the same place when available...

GGGGGrrrrrrr.... (((( BBBBB UUUUUU GGGGG ))))
---------------------------------------------
While developing XWCU, I found an awful bug in B-WING !!
When you destroy a B-Wing during a Tour of Duty mission, it does not appear
in the Battle Victories... And more, whenever you destroy a B-Wing, it is 
counted as a ... mine !

BUT, using XWCU, you can see the number of B-Wing you destroyed ... 
(just see Pilot Log)
